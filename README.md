SteamKitty is a Simple Python3 Program that can be used to trick Steam into letting you use Remote Play as a Remote Desktop tool into your Windows machine

How to use: 
1) Clone repo
2) Add steam_kitty.exe located in dist to Steam as a non-Steam game
3) You should now be able to stream SteamKitty like any other "game"

It will open a GUI window displaying an image briefly before minimizing, and Steam will send you to your desktop (you may have to click the orange antenna button that pops up from Steam)
You can close it in TaskManager, Steam on the host pc, or by holding escape and clicking "stop game" on the connected computer
